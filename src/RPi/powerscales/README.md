# PowerScales Rasberry Pi neopixel controller

Needs https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x to work.

This RPi has four 16-led neopixels, which are mounted on a podium-looking table in the shop.
When you tap your wand on the table the LEDs light up to show you the relative amount of each element.

It has also been known as "health1", "healthpixels", and "healthdisplay"
