# countdown output

ideally an analog clock we can set both the absolute time and the speed forwards and backwards on

located where there's wifi, so hopefully can be an arduino solution

because i don't have the ability to build a 3 hand clock, a compromise is to have

1 progress bar in an arc shape, allowing us to use coloured cardboard connected to a servo that rotates, willing a window
1 spinning hand that shows how fast we're filling or unfilling the status


so

* wemos board
* motor controller board
* servo
* DC motor
* usb power
* maybe another power supply for motor and servo

* [countdown arduino sketch](../src/wemos/wemos_countdown/wemos_countdown.ino)
